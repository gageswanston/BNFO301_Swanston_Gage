        "Crtical regulation of biological functions occurs through binding of genomic DNA by proteins.  For example, in animals the protein HIF-1 binds many sites genome under hypoxic conditions.  The binding of HIF-1 regulates many cellular processes, including ecdysis in insects and response to heart-attack in humans.  Some protein binding sites can be complex, even discontiguous.  Many software applications have been developed to both identify novel candidate binding sites or search for known binding sites.  We will examine the latter today.  \n",

        "Simply finding a match to a binding site does not necessarily imply that the site is used by the protein.  For example, you may want to examine the frequency at which a search pattern occurs using simulations or search for landmarks that are associated with a 'real' binding site.\n",
